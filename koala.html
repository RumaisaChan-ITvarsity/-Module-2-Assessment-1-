         <h3>KOALA</h3>

    <p>
        Koalas, iconic marsupials native to Australia, are instantly recognizable for their fluffy ears, 
        stout bodies, and distinctive spoon-shaped noses. Despite their bear-like appearance,
        koalas are not bears but belong to the marsupial family, along with kangaroos and wombats. 
         These arboreal creatures spend most of their lives in eucalyptus trees, where they feed almost exclusively on the leaves of these trees. Eucalyptus leaves are tough and fibrous, requiring koalas to have specialized digestive systems capable of breaking down the leaves' toxins. Koalas are solitary animals, with each individual typically occupying a home range within their preferred eucalyptus forest. They communicate through vocalizations such as grunts, 
        barks, and bellows, as well as through scent-marking with their specialized scent glands.

 <p>
         Koalas are well adapted to their arboreal lifestyle, with sharp claws for climbing and gripping branches,
         and padded bottoms to provide comfort during long hours of sitting in trees.
 </p>
        Despite their popularity and cultural significance, koalas face threats such as habitat loss, climate change, disease, and bushfires, 
        making conservation efforts critical for their survival in the wild.

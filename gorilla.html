         <h3>GORILLA</h3>

<p>    
Gorillas are magnificent and powerful primates found in the dense forests of central Africa.
They are the largest living primates, distinguished by their robust build, broad chests,
and prominent muscles, which are adapted for their predominantly vegetarian diet.
Gorillas exhibit marked sexual dimorphism, with adult males,
known as silverbacks due to the distinctive silver-gray hair on their backs,
significantly larger and heavier than females. 
These intelligent animals live in cohesive social groups known as troops or bands,
typically led by a dominant silverback who oversees the safety and well-being of the group. 
Gorillas are highly social and exhibit complex behaviors, including grooming, play, 
and vocal communication through a variety of vocalizations and gestures.
They primarily feed on leaves, stems, fruits, and other vegetation found in their forest habitat,
spending much of their day foraging. Despite their impressive size and strength,
gorillas are generally gentle and peaceful creatures,
preferring to avoid conflict when possible. 
</p>
However, they fiercely defend their families and territories if threatened. Despite being protected by conservation efforts, gorilla populations face significant threats from habitat destruction, poaching, and diseases,
 highlighting the importance of continued conservation measures to ensure their survival in the wild.

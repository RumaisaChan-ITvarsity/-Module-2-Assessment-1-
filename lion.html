         <h3>LION</h3>

    <p>
        Lions, often referred to as the kings of the jungle, are majestic and iconic big cats that inhabit the grasslands, 
        savannas, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. These social predators are known for their distinctive golden coats, muscular builds, and impressive manes, which are more prominent in males and vary in color and length depending on their age and genetics. Lions are apex predators, occupying the top of the food chain in their ecosystems, and typically hunt in coordinated groups called prides, consisting of related females and their offspring, along with a few dominant males. Female lions are the primary hunters within the pride, using teamwork and stealth to bring down prey such as wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes,
        while males often defend the pride's territory and offspring from rival males and predators.

 <p>
    Lions communicate through vocalizations such as roars, grunts, and growls,
    which can be heard over long distances and play a crucial role in maintaining social bonds within the pride. 
 </p>
 <p>
    Despite their status as apex predators, lions face threats such as habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, poaching, and disease, 
    leading to declining populations across Africa and highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to ensure their survival in the wild.

         <h3>TIGER</h3>

    <p>
        The tiger, scientifically known as Panthera tigris, is one of the most iconic and majestic big cats roaming the forests, grasslands, and swamps of Asia. Renowned for its distinctive orange fur, dark stripes, and powerful build, the tiger is the largest member of the Felidae family and holds the title of the largest cat species in the world. Tigers possess a range of adaptations that make them formidable predators, including sharp claws, strong jaws, and keen senses of sight, smell, and hearing. They are solitary hunters, stalking their prey with stealth and precision before pouncing with lightning-fast agility. Tigers are apex predators,
         playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems by controlling herbivore populations.

 <p>
    However, these magnificent animals are facing significant threats, including habitat loss,
     poaching for their skins and body parts, human-wildlife conflict, and dwindling prey populations. 
 </p>
   
 <p>
    As a result, all subspecies of tigers are endangered, with conservation efforts focused on protecting their remaining habitats, combating poaching,
     and raising awareness about the importance of preserving these iconic creatures for future generations.

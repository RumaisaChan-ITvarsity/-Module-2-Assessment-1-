         <h3>WARTHOG</h3>

    <p>
        Warthogs, characterized by their distinctive appearance with large tusks and wart-like protrusions on their faces, are wild members of the pig family found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite their somewhat intimidating appearance, warthogs are generally docile and social animals, often seen foraging in small family groups called sounders. They have adapted to a variety of habitats, including savannas, grasslands, and woodlands, where they feed primarily on grasses, roots, fruits, and tubers. Warthogs are well-known for their habit of kneeling down on their calloused, padded knees to feed, a behavior that gives them easy access to low-growing vegetation. Their large, curved tusks are formidable weapons used for defense against predators such as lions, hyenas, and leopards. In addition to their tusks,
         warthogs also possess impressive speed and agility, enabling them to quickly evade danger when necessary.

 <p>
    While they are generally resilient animals, 
    warthogs face threats from habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict in some areas.  
 </p>
 Conservation efforts are crucial to ensuring the survival of these fascinating and important components of African ecosystems.

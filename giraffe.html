         <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>

    <p>
     Giraffes, scientifically known as Giraffa camelopardalis,
     are iconic and majestic creatures that inhabit the open savannas and woodlands of Africa. 
     Instantly recognizable by their towering height, long necks, and distinctively patterned coats,
     giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, with some individuals reaching heights of up to 18 feet (5.5 meters).
     Their long necks, which can measure over six feet (1.8 meters) in length, are equipped with only seven vertebrae, just like in other mammals, but each one is elongated to allow for their impressive browsing capabilities. With their prehensile tongues reaching lengths of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters), giraffes can effortlessly strip leaves from the tallest branches of acacia trees, their primary food source. Their coats feature irregular patches or spots that vary in coloration, helping to provide camouflage in their natural habitat. Despite their imposing size,
     giraffes are gentle herbivores, typically living in loose, social groups called towers,
     consisting of females and their young, led by a dominant male.

    These sociable animals communicate through various vocalizations,
    including low-frequency sounds that are often too low for human ears to detect. 
 </p>
    While giraffes are iconic symbols of the African savanna, their populations face threats from habitat loss,
    poaching, and human-wildlife conflict,
    making conservation efforts crucial for their long-term survival.
